Mind you being dyslexic, even though I had a good memory, I had problems learning enough to come away with any qualifications, but I did manage to get a job as a private Nanny, which lead to more roles within child care, which lasted for just over 13 years, even after getting married and having my first child.\nThen after the birth of my second child, I took up volunteering for charities, as retail assistant and now my dream is to eventually open up my own secondhand and vintage shop.\n",

I think it is more given to people with a different mindset.\n\u00a0We can also say about languages, biology, chemistry, political science, history, ecology, that are well received by other children.\nBut I would like to keep your attention to the following aspect.\nEducation and formation of a person. Society needs decent,kind, well-mannered people.\nThose who understand the values of life, relationships between people, care, love of humanity, respect, politeness. It is necessary to be kind in order to raise a good generation. In addition, I would add ethics and behavior, culture and art. In the future, the children themselves will choose which science is closer to them and what they want deepen.There may be classes with advanced study of math.But of course, if you can create methods and mechanisms for better understanding and development, then why not?",

English could be mixed with spanish or another language at an earlier time because being young your mind absorb like a sponge. History could of been better by doing a family history so you can talk about that era and it would peek most kids interests. So many levels in that too that could of been covered.",

See history is based on point of view, and let me tell you, if your a reader like I was growing up, you realized what they we teaching us in those history books was skewed to a particular narrative! \n\nI became a teacher and have a composite Social Studies teaching certification from Texas! My kids (students) always loved it when we talked the rise and fall of civilization and my first question to them always was? How did their toilets work? What type of plumbing did they have? And so many more questions about how society grew, not who and what year did they exist! \nIt was more about the engineering of society, not the history! \nToday\u2019s education misses the mark, the math does not add up, and the barritives change daily! But for one moment in time I taught the rise and the fall, and it was not about the power play in history, it was more about the how they designed how to live!",

In my JHS, I was told that the USA won the 1776 war because the British soldiers just stood there and got shot. They said that's how wars were fought back then - line up on opposite sides and shoot. I mean, come on! \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udd88 That's like saying sharks only swim in straight lines. We all know there's more depth to history, just as there's more to the ocean's currents.\nIt's essential to teach history accurately, just as it's crucial to make subjects like math engaging. Thanks for doing your part with that groovy playlist! \ud83c\udfb6\nKeep making waves, Bill! And remember, history might be written by the victors, but it's up to us to ensure it's told correctly.\nSpread Shark Love #GabenFreUde \ud83e\udd88\u2764\ufe0f #divineintervention.

Reason being that learning started from  a strong vernacular background on which you had to understand concepts from the mother tongue. Unfortunately as I grew through classes things changed that I had to learn English to understand all the subjects. \nMaths became difficult because of English or I had to transillitrate questions to the native language to understand it. Anyway every subject is easy but it depends with the teacher, language, environment, time of introduction.\nThe worst was fear and terror unleashed by the teacher should you get the answer wrong. Many strokes Infront of you fellow pupils as you cry all your tears while others laugh at you.\nAll these frustrations demoralized me and hated maths. Am sorry it was a nightmare.",

In addition, mathematical knowledge plays a crucial role in understanding the contents of other school subjects such as science, social studies, and even music and art.\n\nScience instils a sense of intrigue and enables students to develop understanding and form questions based both on the knowledge they already have and the insight they wish to gain in the future. Students who excel in science lessons are likely to develop a strong ability to think critically.\n\nEnglish is important for students as it broadens their minds, develops emotional skills, improve the quality of life by providing job opportunities. Moreover, the use of English as an International language is growing with time because it is the only medium for communication in many countries.\n\nBecause history gives us the tools to analyze and explain problems in the past, it positions us to see patterns that might otherwise be invisible in the present \u2013 thus providing a crucial perspective for understanding (and solving!) current and future problems.",

I detested science,  but that was partly due to a ghastly teacher insulting me. He who is quite legendary in Sandwich . Portly children, short or small children were picked on in the same manner with verbal bullying  insults. Today there would a legal challenge made for sure . Lucky he retired then isn't it. Time is also a great healer in cases like these.\nI am not mistaken because he picked on my wonderful wife some twelve years later . Helen is big , beautiful & clever , she also attained a double A in science  . Yet was often called S***.\nHow difficult it is then ,when one has ADHD & Dyxlexia to take on  the pains that are Algebra, Equation & Logarithm. Arithmetic was generally easy up until that point .I humiliated myself by copying figures from my old pal Mike Burch  who was very proficient , helpful & hardworking . However this was done in a hurried muddled confusion just to keep- up some kind of make believe  momentum. \nSadly & not surprisingly it made no difference whatsoever & perhaps its the most just conclusion in this instance & in this particular case . \u00a9\ufe0f",

The outcome is always the same, no matter what technique you use to get to the answer, if the person clicks with it, they will arrive at the same ability as everyone else that can do that particular type of math, and the same answers to the curriculum's tests. Creativity is not punished if the student finds a unique but ultimately correct way of getting to the answer.\n\nShort of copying someone else's work, you'll never have two people answer the same for the majority of what is taught in English. So how do you coach or teach such a subjective subject without killing creativity? Who here remembers what happened to the students who disagreed that Romeo & Juliet was a tragedy?  English --  A subjective subject that seems to have only one narrow range of correct answers based mostly on who's teaching it. There's got to be a better way!",

I will definitely listen to the playlist. :) Those who understand Hindi, there is a very popular chartbuster in Bollywood from late 80\u2019s- \u2018Ek Do Teen Char..\u2019 that describes how a girl spends the entire 30 days of the month waiting on her love to return picturized on actress Madhuri Dixit. Many toddlers learnt counting listening to it. Do listen and enjoy her dance! By the way my least favorite subject at school was History until we found a great teacher in High school who changed my opinion about it. He sadly passed away sometime ago but not before bringing a positive change to many students like me! #musicbringsusalltogether",

So I took a Humanities degree (Archaeology), travelled, met incredible people, travelled some more, had a fantastic first career and then changed direction when the time came. Now I work with technologists in government. Sure, nothing to do with archaeology but\u2026that Humanities degree taught me to be curious and interested in all kinds of things. Math is great, but curiosity rocks.",

Even though I believe all sciences is a combination of Maths and Philosophy,  I didn't like the way Maths was being taught at school. Probably, because as the origin of the word indicates you need someone to teach you maths (mathematics comes from the Greek word \u03bc\u03ac\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1 which means lesson). And you need someone good, maths needs to be taught in a very interactive and applicable to reality way in order to prosper in children's mind.",

History English and even science or communication heavy pursuits but math is often solitary.  I have found very few math teachers patient or driven to teach. There are always exceptions. I know my geometry teacher was incapable of communicating the relevance in the real world. It was not until I explored carpentry and roofing that angles, area, capacity, and volume all really made sense. ",
