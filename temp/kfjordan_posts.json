Are you (and your #event) prepared for a potential #recession?\n\nWhen budgeting in a time of financial uncertainty be sure you consider the following:\n\n1) Do you have a plan if your #meeting or #tradeshow occurs during a recession that\u2019s seeing a 30%-50% drop in sales? (i.e.: What's the potential revenue impact? This is especially important for B2C and B2B tradeshows, but also those #meetings with exhibitors and sponsors who may also need to make different financial decisions during a recession).\n\n2) What if, at the same time, your meeting or tradeshow costs are rising 10%-30% with inflation?\n\n3) What are ways your meeting or event can continue to grow during a recession? (and what are the implications and ramifications if it can't grow?)\n\nDon't be caught off guard! Paying close attention to economic conditions and trends and making prudent decisions early can help you slow down some of the potential negative financial impacts during a recession.\n\n#meetingprofs #eventprofs #meetingsmeanbusiness #meetingsandevents",

If you're a #meetingprof or #eventprof planning a domestic event, these increases may impact your already hurting attendee base and your consistent attendees may reconsider shelling out the dollars to attend your #meeting or #event.\n\nIf you're planning international events, travel outside of the US is still down 20 - 40%, so your attendees may not feel the sticker shock, but they may still have re-entry COVID-19 hurdles to deal with.\n\n#meetingprofs #eventprofs #meetingsmeanbusiness #travel #airlines",

Staying disciplined to purpose is always tough, but especially now. And I think it\u2019s still the right approach. \n\nThe challenge of leadership right now is to meet the moment while staying true to our mission. Not easy, but grounded in purpose. #association #leadership #COVID19 #organizationaldevelopment",

There is also some unfair deflection ---i.e hotels continue to benefit (i.e. profit) from a simpler RFP submission even if they've had to add additional staff, etc. (i.e. cost of business) & CVENT is NOT solely to blame for incomplete RFPs.\n",
