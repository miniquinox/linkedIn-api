Renewable energy sources like wind and solar getting cheaper, and many of the steps already taken to reduce carbon emissions are working. But more than anything else, I\u2019m optimistic because of the incredible innovation happening every day.\u00a0It\u2019s true that new tools aren\u2019t the only thing we need to meet our zero-emissions goals, but we won\u2019t solve the climate problem without them.",

        "Post Description": "For those of you who have been following along, you\u2019ll recall that in May the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation launched a Grand Challenges global call for proposals dedicated to the equitable use of AI in low- and middle-income countries.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWe did this because we were concerned that many of the geographies that we focus on had not yet had a chance to participate in the debate on how AI could fundamentally change lives for the better. We wanted to broaden the conversation and ensure that local innovators and problem-solvers were the ones identifying both the needs of their respective communities and the potential utility of AI solutions.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe response to the RFP exceeded our wildest imaginations \u2013 we received over 1,300 proposals within two weeks and were infused with a sea of interesting ideas. Today, I\u2019m thrilled to share that we\u2019re funding nearly 50 new Grand Challenges grant recipients who are developing global health and development solutions for their communities using AI-enabled LLMs.\u00a0You can read more about the selected projects here: https://lnkd.in/eBhuqTre ",

Some of my fondest childhood memories took place in Paul Allen\u2019s basement, where he\u2019d turn on the record player and turn me on to artists like Jimi Hendrix and albums like Are You Experienced? And like a lot of people, when I got older, I discovered the joys of listening to a great song while going for a drive. These days, I love learning about new songs and artists through recommendations from my kids, who have great ears, and friends like Bono (whose ear isn\u2019t too shabby, either). \n\u00a0\nThis Spotify playlist includes many of my favorites\u2014songs newer and older that have stuck with me over the years. Whether you're hosting a backyard BBQ, sitting on the beach, or just driving around with the windows down, feel free to make it part of the soundtrack to your summer, too.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHappy listening!",

        "Post Description": "Last week in Kemmerer, Wyoming, we celebrated the progress and promise of next-generation nuclear power. TerraPower LLC\u2019s Natrium project is a testament to what can be accomplished when communities, businesses, and government leaders come together to create a better future. \n\u00a0\nThe Natrium plant will be the world's most advanced nuclear power plant, opening in 2030. It's safer and produces less waste than conventional reactors, using liquid sodium as a coolant and an energy storage system. Building the Natrium facility will also bring 1,600 construction jobs to town and provide a boost to the local economy. It is essential for integrating power grids that use renewable power sources like solar and wind. \n\u00a0\nI had a wonderful time in Kemmerer celebrating this milestone, and I'm grateful to Governor Mark Gordon and Senator John Barrasso for their strong support. I also want to thank the people of Kemmerer for their warm welcome and for all the hard work they've put into making this project a reality. I'm confident that the Natrium plant will be a game-changer for the energy industry and for the people of Wyoming:\u00a0https://lnkd.in/gMEwyWsy",

We need urgent action to address PPH, which is why this new approach led by our partners, University of Birmingham and World Health Organization, is so exciting: It could drastically improve women\u2019s chances of surviving childbirth globally. No woman should fear for her life when giving birth, and this new package of interventions makes me hopeful that we\u2019re getting one step closer to a future where no woman will.",

The first time was in 1980, when I was introduced to a graphical user interface\u2014the forerunner of every modern operating system, including Windows. The second big surprise came just last year. I\u2019d been meeting with the team from OpenAI since 2016 and was impressed by their steady progress. In mid-2022, I was so excited about their work that I gave them a challenge: train an artificial intelligence to pass an Advanced Placement biology exam. Make it capable of answering questions that it hasn\u2019t been specifically trained for. (I picked AP Bio because the test is more than a simple regurgitation of scientific facts\u2013it asks you to think critically about biology.) If you can do that, I said, then you\u2019ll have made a true breakthrough. I thought the challenge would keep them busy for two or three years. They finished it in just a few months.",

        "Post Description": "The world has been doing more to save lives \u2014 and it\u2019s showing. Childhood deaths have fallen by half since 2000. But within this progress, there\u2019s a tragically persistent problem: the number of babies who die in the first 30 days of life is not dropping nearly as fast. Almost 1.9 million newborns died in 2019, only a third fewer than in 2000.\n\u00a0\nTo make a dent in newborn mortality, health workers need to deal with underlying causes as early as possible, often before a baby is even born. Technology can provide a promising new approach to simplify the ultrasound process:\u00a0https://lnkd.in/gq2fteFB",

First, avoiding a climate disaster would be the hardest challenge people had ever faced. Second, the only way to do it was to invest aggressively in clean-energy innovation and deployment. And third, we needed to get going. I am optimistic about what people are capable of in a crisis, and in the long run, I wouldn\u2019t bet against us. Unfortunately, we don\u2019t have the luxury of a long run. We have already achieved many energy breakthroughs. We need to achieve more, faster, to avoid a climate disaster.\n\u00a0\nThe good news is that we\u2019re much further along than I would have predicted a few years ago on developing and deploying zero-carbon breakthroughs. I\u2019m optimistic that the pace and scale of innovation will continue in 2023 and beyond. #BigIdeas2023",

That's why getting to zero cases is a top priority for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and partners like Rotary International. We can\u2019t afford to lose sight of our goal to #EndPolio for good.",

It was very cool to walk through labs and see their work in person. \n\nAnd to top it all off, I ran into Jose Zamora Zeledon. He\u2019s a Gates Millennium Scholar focused on researching the development of high-performance electrocatalytic interfaces for hydrogen fuel cell applications. Incredible stuff.",

They're how we figure out hard choices, help each other grow, and feel like we're a part of something bigger.\n\nSo when Vanderbilt University asked me to give a Graduates Day address, I didn't speak about entrepreneurism, technological innovation, or career-planning. \n\nI spoke about friendship.

But climate ambition won\u2019t translate automatically into climate impact. We must put action behind our commitments with bold efforts to eliminate global emissions by 2050.\n\nWhile it may seem urgent to look inward at our own emissions as companies, countries, or individuals, to actually make the transition to a net-zero economy, we need to look beyond our individual emissions, and instead look outward and judge our activities by how they will help the global economy achieve net-zero emissions. \n\u00a0\nTo achieve the type of change we need the world needs to think creatively about each step in the innovation chain from lab to commercialization \u2013 and remain focused on reducing Green Premiums. In the Breakthrough Energy 2022 Outlook, we discuss the bold, comprehensive action needed to accelerate the transition:",

            "Original Post Description": "For over a decade now, I\u2019ve written an annual letter to the CEOs of the companies in which our clients are invested to promote themes that I believe are important to creating long-term value. \n\u00a0\nThis year\u2019s letter focuses on embracing the power of capitalism as a catalyst for change and the importance of companies delivering for all their stakeholders. Companies today must create value for their employees, clients, and communities in order to deliver long-term value for their shareholders. And I believe the pandemic has made this imperative more important than ever.\n\u00a0\nStakeholder capitalism is not about politics, or a particular social or ideological agenda. It is about driving durable profitability. The pandemic is changing how people live and work, and it\u2019s redefining the relationship between companies, their employees, and society. CEOs are facing a very different paradigm today than they did even a few years ago. Workers are demanding higher wages and more meaningful work from their employers. We must adapt. \n\u00a0\nConstant reinvention is the foundation of effective capitalism. Companies that fail to evolve to meet the needs of their clients, shareholders, employees, and communities will find themselves unable to attract top talent, threatened by more innovative competitors, and most crucially, unable to navigate the transition to net zero. \n\u00a0\nAs a CEO myself, I know that delivering on the (sometimes competing) interests of a company\u2019s many divergent stakeholders is not easy, especially in a polarized world. That is why it is more important than ever for CEOs to have a consistent voice and for companies to be guided by their purpose.\n\u00a0\nI hope you\u2019ll take a few minutes to read this year\u2019s letter. https://lnkd.in/gRstC8X",

That\u2019s why Breakthrough Energy Catalyst is building a community of public and private sector partners to support the green energy transition. Catalyst\u2019s private-sector partners represent a wide range of industries, from financial and consulting, to automotive and manufacturing \u2013 and now Shell has shared its intention to join as the program\u2019s first energy anchor partner. These partners have invested in Catalyst to accelerate the development and adoption of critical climate technologies we need to meaningfully reduce emissions. Breakthrough Energy is proud to be working with this growing community of partners that are all taking serious steps toward reaching net zero.\n\u00a0\nhttps://lnkd.in/eS8VMGnm",

Knowing we could not do it alone, we set our sights on tackling the hard problems of data access by closely collaborating with others who share our goals. We started by dedicating the right resources to build the right data-sharing platform for the Alzheimer\u2019s research community. We also knew that our work would not be done until the Alzheimer\u2019s community told us to stop.\n\nAs I reflect upon ADDI's first year, I want to share with you our achievements, some of the lessons we learned along the way, and the work we still have left to do in the next year and beyond.\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/dn7C7ynF",

This collaboration\u2019s impact is made possible through investments in the bipartisan infrastructure bill, which will unleash billions in private capital for clean energy projects throughout the U.S. if passed into law. \n\nThank you to Secretary Jennifer Granholm and the DOE for their partnership.",

            "Original Post Description": "I am deeply saddened to learn that Dr. Tachi Yamada, who ran the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation's Global Health Program from 2005 to 2011, passed away yesterday. He was a leader that personified our mission by combining empathy with the tenacious pursuit of equity and impact. I remember him as especially devoted to measuring impact, famously quoting a former boss that \"If you're not keeping score, you\u2019re just practicing.\" I'm going to use that at my next tennis match. He earned the respect of colleagues and partners by showing them respect. As news of his passing spread throughout the foundation and our alumni network, it was clear that many of us are truly devastated to lose Tachi, but his legacy will live on in the foundation he helped to build and the many talented people he mentored over a 50-year career.",

        "Post Description": "When I was in my 20s and early 30s, I was fanatical about software. I didn\u2019t take vacations or weekends off and I wasn\u2019t interested in getting married. (Obviously, that changed when I met Melinda!). \n\nNow, much of my work involves learning from other fanatics and it's opened up an amazing new chapter in my life. Here are some of the incredible people I met in 2016.",
