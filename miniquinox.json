        "Post Description": "I\u2019m happy to share that I\u2019m starting a new position as a Consumer Device Engineer at Meta! Some of you might know I am from Spain, but I grew up in Equatorial Guinea, Africa, where technology wasn't really part of our lives. I always found it fascinating how technology grows at an incredible pace, and not only does it find a way to perfection, but it adapts to our needs. Since I moved to the USA it has been my sole dream to be part of Facebook, as it kept me connected with my family all those years growing up in different continents. \n\nToday marks my first day at Meta, where I will be working with the Facebook Reality Labs team with Gabriel Molina. I am incredibly thankful to be part of something so big like Meta, and interact closely with the future - the Metaverse.\n\nI wanted to take a minute to thank everyone who pushed me harder to learn new technologies and never let me fall behind. #team #engineer #technology #future #facebook #meta #newbeginings",

Full dynamic lighting with no baking.\n\nNotes : You might recognize this place from Red Dead Redemption 2 (aka Braithwaite manor). I couldn't believe how beautiful this place was when I played the game, and it happens that the place is inspired by the Oak Alley Plantation down in Louisiana. I decided to inspire my self from it and started modeling out in 3DS Max with reference images.\nYou can imagine the library of cars that went through my mind to recreate this scene. And it's another Ferrari.. Really?\n\nI used SpeedTree (IDV, inc) for the trees, and Quixel Megascans assets for the environment. Car and Manor was textured using Substance by Adobe Painter. \n\nManor modeled by me using 3DS Max. \nCar model by Grabcad and customized by me.\n\nEDIT : All High Res now available on my website : https://lnkd.in/gh2TYrt\n\n#unrealengine #raytracing #ue4 #automotive #ferrari #250 #substance #megascans #quadrortx #nvidia #virtualproduction  #cars",
