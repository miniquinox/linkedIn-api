If you used the Lyft app in the last year or so, anywhere in the US or Canada, the algorithm we wrote helped find the best available driver for your trip. Feel free to take a look if you want to understand what happens behind the curtain when you request a ride!\n\nWe used online reinforcement learning to learn how to better match drivers to passengers in real-time and constantly improve, a first for ridesharing companies.\n\nThe project was challenging, as it took over a year to make the algorithm work and obtain the required buy-in from across the company. However, the results were well worth the effort and benefit everyone: passengers are happier (more 5-star reviews and a 13 percent decrease of situations where no driver is available to pick up a customer), drivers are busier, and the new algorithm generated over $30 million a year in increased revenue.\n\nThe project is currently a finalist in the INFORMS Franz Edelman award, thanks to the effort of Lyft\u2019s incredible team:\n\nXabier AZAGIRRE, Nicholas Chamandy, Benjamin Han, Vijay Narasiman, Zhiwei (Tony) Qin, Akshay Balwally, Guillaume Candeli, Alona King, Hyungjun Lee, Martin Loncaric, Baptiste Richard, Sara Smoot, Sean Taylor, Garrett van Ryzin, Di Wu, Alex Zamoshchin",
